- Explain the order of execution in terms of the event loop for eventloop/poll_timer.js.
- Will the order of execution change if the delay in the while loop is changed from 10s to 150s? Why or why not?
Yes, the order of execution will change. If the delay in the while loop is increased to 150 milliseconds, 
the overall time spent in the event loop before the setTimeout callback is executed will increase, 
potentially delaying the execution of the timer callback.
- Will the order of execution change if timeout is changed to 0? Why or why not?
No, changing the timeout to 0 milliseconds won't change the order of execution. 
The timer with a delay of 0 milliseconds will still be scheduled to execute in the next available event loop iteration, 
ensuring that it runs after the currently executing synchronous code and any other tasks in the event loop.
