- In eventloop/poll.js, what will be the order of execution? Briefly explain the order of execution w.r.t the event loop phases.

The order of execution is "foo", "done", and then, depending on the completion of the asynchronous file read operation, either "Read Error" or "Data: ...". 
The asynchronous operation allows the event loop to continue executing other tasks while waiting for the file read to complete.
